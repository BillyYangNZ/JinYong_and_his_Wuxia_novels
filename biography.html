				Louis Cha (Chinese: 查良鏞; 6 February 1924 – 30 October 2018),
				better known by Jin Yong (Chinese: 金庸),
				was a Chinese wuxia ("martial arts and chivalry") novelist.
				He was named along with Gu Long and Liang Yusheng as the "Three Legs of the Tripod of Wuxia".
			</p><br>
			<p>
				After Cha completed all his works, it was discovered that
				the first characters of the first 14 titles can be joined together
				to form a couplet with 7 characters on each line:
				Shooting a white deer, snow flutters around the skies;
				Smiling, [one] writes about the divine chivalrous one,
				leaning	against bluish lovebirds (or lover).
